It is not necessary that every time you should use return 0 to return program's execution status from the main() function. But returned value indicates program's success or failure to the operating system and there is only one value that is 0 which can indicate success and other non zero values can indicate failure of execution due to many reasons. 
For example - if program's execution fails due to lake of memory we can return -1, if it fails due to file opening we can return -2, if it fails due to any invalid input value we can return -3 and so on. If program's execution is success we should return 0.
