# What is our project about?
---
Our project is about finding lost things. Lost and found items retrieval process is one of the major problems which needs further 
development. Traditional way of reporting for lost or found items requires a great deal of both time and effort. Consequently, 
citizens are hesitant in reporting such items due to the complex and prolonged procedure, with authorities required to expend 
many work hours in attempts to provide a hasty response to such reports. 

So, we have made a new approach to improve the lost and found items reporting procedure with our website. This website offers a 
user-friendly form for reporting items’ with the feature of easy pinpointing to lost or found items. User can give necessary 
information of the lost or found item here. Users don't even need to search manually for items because our system automatically detects
matched item from database and provide necessary contacts.
