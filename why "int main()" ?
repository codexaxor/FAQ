There are many variations of main() function, but now a days it's a standard that we should return some value (an integer value) to the calling/parent function.
Since main() calls by the operating system at the time of program's execution, returned value reaches to the operating system which indicates that function/ program is executed successfully or not.
So we should use this variation of main() function but we really donâ€™t know what operating system does with returned value?
